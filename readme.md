# Java Custom Library Commons POM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/time1015/java-custom-lib-commons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/time1015/java-custom-lib-commons)

An ancestral Bill-of-Materials Maven POM for Custom Libraries to inherit from.

This contains common configuration and management for dependent projects to reference from, without having to redundantly list down and specify in their own POM configurations.

## Java Version

This requires that Java 11 be used for compilation and runtime.

## Changelog

Changelog is found [here](./changelog.md).
